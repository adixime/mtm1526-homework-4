# Tabbed interface
## by:- Aditya Gupta

---

*Create a simple tabbed interface with four tabs. Clicking on the tabs should show the content for a single tab and hide all others.

*Use jQuery effects when switching tabs.

*Style the tabs so they look nice.. The active tab should have a style that is different from the other tabs.
